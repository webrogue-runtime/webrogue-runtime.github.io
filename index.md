> This page is outdated. Webrogue is currently being rewritten to Rust and goals slightly changed. New repo is [here](https://github.com/webrogue-runtime/webrogue_rs).

Webrogue is a runtime based on WebAssembly. 
Thanks to its design, webrogue offers the following key advantages:
- [Portable](benefits/portable.html)
- [Modular](benefits/modular.html)
- [Cross-platform](benefits/cross_platform.html)
- [Programming-language-agnostic](benefits/programming_languages.html)
- [Bakeable](benefits/bakeable.html)

And of course webrogue is [open source](https://github.com/webrogue-runtime/webrogue).

Here are two online demos:
- [Baked log2048 demo](demos/baked_log2048/).
- [Dynamic demo](demos/dynamic/).

Webrogue is currently in active development and will change significantly(see [goals](goals/)), so it is not recommended for production use. 
I'm welcome contributions from the community.

It might seem that webrogue depends on browser. 
It is not so. 
You can run webrogue without any sort of browser installed, and webrogue does not ships any.
