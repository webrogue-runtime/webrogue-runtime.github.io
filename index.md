Webrogue is a game runtime based on WebAssembly. 
Thanks to it's design, Webrogue offers the following key advantages:
- [Portable](benefits/portable)
- [Modular](benefits/modular)
- [Cross-platform](benefits/cross_platform)
- [Programming-language-agnostic](benefits/programming_languages)
- [Bakeable](benefits/bakeable)
- [Open source](https://github.com/Destructor17/webrogue)

Here are two online demos:
- [Backed demo](backed_game/).
- [Dynamic demo](game/).

Webrogue is currently in active development and will change significantly, so it is not recommended for production use. 
I'm welcome contributions from the community.

It might seem that Webrogue depends on browser. 
It is not so. 
You can run Webrogue without any sort of browser, for example, on Windows Command Prompt, on Linux over SSH, on macOS in terminal app, potentially even on DOS.
