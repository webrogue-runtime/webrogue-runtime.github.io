title: Android support for Webrogue
---

Webrogue supports compiling WRAPPs to APK files for Android.
To compile WRAPP to Android application, you need Android SDK 35.
Path to Android SDK should be specified using `--sdk` option or `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.
You can compile Android application with following command:

```webrogue compile android <WRAPP_PATH> <BUILD_DIR> --sdk <PATH>```

Once again, `--sdk` option is not mandatory if `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is available.
To optionally signing your APK, use `--keystore-path`, `--store-password` `--key-password` and `--key-alias` options.

Also Webrogue offers an app to run WRAPP files on android using JIT compilation.

Only AArch64 CPUs are currently supported.
Most Android devices are AArch64-based.
Exceptions are some old devices, ultra low-end devices, and many emulators.

# Implementation details
Webrogue generates Gradle Android project (initially generated by Android Studio) to build Android apps.

Then Webrogue links compiled object and libraries shipped with `webrogue` utility, just like for Windows or Linux.
The only difference is that linking result is a shared library, which is placed to Gradle project.
So Gradle doesn't builds any native code, only Java code.

Android devices ships OpenGL ES drives, so no graphics emulation layer is required.

SWRAPP is bundled as uncompressed Android asset.
It means it is not required to unpack it to provide non-sequential access.
SWRAPP itself is a compressed file format, so lack of asset compression doesn't increases resulting APK size.
