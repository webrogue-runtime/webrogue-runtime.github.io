title: Webrogue's portability
---

Webrogue packs games into portable __Webrogue mods__, which will be called just __mods__. 

Mods are compressed archive files with custom format and `.wrmod` extension.
They contain WebAssembly code and game resources.
It means that developer can distribute his game as a single file.

More of this, usage of WebAssembly makes a game cross-platform.
So developer distributing his games as mods does not need to care about what OS or CPU architecture user have.
