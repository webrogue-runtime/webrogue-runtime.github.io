This page is just a list of things that would be nice to implement in future
- ncurses support using libtsm for terminal emulation  
- pure stdin/stdout/stderr mode, without ncurses or something, but use sdl terminal emulator if needed
- more programming languages
- debugging without native runtime
- network support
- CLI options
- bazel support
- multiple static archives in one wrmod, and including them conditionally
- package manager
- vulkan api
- wrapp files(just a bundle of mods)
- android app factory(a possibility to generate apk files form wrmod/wrapp using android webrogue app)
- LLVM aot runtime(like wasm2c runtime)
- try to compile for game devices, such as xbox, playstation and nintendo switch
- try to add v8 runtime
- try to add JavaScriptCore runtime without wasmer

Here is a list of examples that probably worth being implemented
- Doom
- Podman over QEMU
- llama.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp and other AI examples
- DOSBox
- port React Native, Flutter, QT, etc using Vulkan
