The first app made on webrogue is log2048. 
It is inspired by [2048 puzzle](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) (not sure if I should provide exactly this link). 

Original 2048 puzzle is a single-player sliding puzzle game. 
The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the objective is to combine tiles of the same number to reach the elusive tile with the number 2048. 
In 2048 numbers on combined tiles are doubled, while in log2048 numbers are just incremented.
In fact it is almost the same just because if you will play 2048, but logarithm to base 2 of a number will be displayed instead of actual number, it would look the same. 
That's why it is named log2048.

Players can move tiles in four directions – up, down, left, and right – with each move causing all tiles to slide in that direction until they hit the edge or another tile, while combining if possible.
Tiles are moved either by swipes of finger over touchscreen or mouse with pressed left button or by arrow keys on keyboard.
